# Christomization — Hackathon Game Jam

A 2-hour game jam where small groups build a game starring **Chris**, our PM, using a stack that was deliberately chosen *for* you: **Phaser 4 + TypeScript + Vite**.

You are not expected to know Phaser. You are not expected to know Node. You are not expected to walk away knowing them either. The point is to experiment with what's possible when you collaborate with **Claude** without your usual constraints — no backend, no pipelines, no Jira — and see how far you can push it in two hours.

At T+2hr we demo by screen-share. Show whatever you built.

## How it works

1. **Fork** this repo on GitHub. Your group works in your fork.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. Install and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:8080. Edits hot-reload.
4. Run `claude` in the repo. `CLAUDE.md` and the Phaser skill pack under `.claude/skills/` load automatically — Claude already knows the project layout, the asset paths, and how Phaser 4 works.
5. Build. Push to your fork.
6. At T+2hr — screen-share demo.

## The star

Three Chris sprites live in `public/chris/`:

- `normal-chris.png`
- `super-chris.png`
- `french-chris.png`

Use them however you want. Platformer, shooter, rhythm game, idle clicker, dating sim, kart racer — your call.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm install` | Install dependencies (once) |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server on http://localhost:8080 with hot reload |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Surface TypeScript errors Vite hides in dev |

Everything else (project layout, how to load assets, where scenes live, house rules) lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — or just ask Claude.
